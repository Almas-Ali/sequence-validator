# Sequence Validator

I found a random statement about math at Facebook and I wanted to validate it. The statement was, "If you divide 1 by 998,001 you get all three-digit numbers from 000 to 999 in order except for 998." I wanted to validate this statement and see if it was true. I wrote a Python script to validate this statement and it was true. I have stored the value in a file for future reference. Also tested if every value is a three-digit number and if the sequence is in order. The script is in the file `sequence-validator.py`.

## How to run the script

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Almas-Ali/sequence-validator.git

# Change the directory
cd sequence-validator

# Run the script
python sequence-validator.py
```
**Note: You need to have Python3 installed on your system to run the script.**

## Output

The output of the script is stored in the file for testing purposes. It is in `output-decimals.txt` which is raw decimal values and `output-testing.txt` which is processed value for sequence count. Your free to mess with it.

## Conclusion

The statement was true. If you divide 1 by 998,001 you get all three-digit numbers from 000 to 999 in order except for 998.

## Moral of the story

Don't believe everything you read on the internet. Always validate the information before sharing it with others.

**Math is fun!**
